    \section{Executive Summary}
        \subsection{Background}
            Riding the wave of "IoT Revolution" \cite{Forbes}, this project will develop
            a low cost, easily deployable IoT product in any setting.
            \\
            IoT or \textit{The Internet of Things} has proven to be an explosive trend within
            the consumer electronics markets. Never before have such small versatile devices been
            available for general consumption, leading to an estimated combined business and
            consumer spending value in excess of \$6 \textit{trillion} dollars globally in 2018 \cite{Forbes}
            \\
            For the vast majority of consumers, both corporate and end-customer \cite{Mckinsey}, a large 
            movement toward both minimisation of waste and optimisation of spending is occuring
            on a global scale in the developed world, with the developing world rapidly following 
            this trend also \cite{SunNews}.
            \\
            Citing this movement, it would only be logical to create a simple to use set of devices 
            that allow for the monitoring and therefore optimisation of such measurables.

        \subsection{Overview and Purpose}
            The concept of this project is to create a distributed system in which small 
            devices are used to monitor, log and analyse a number of select metrics from a 
            multitude of potential data points.
            \\
            The purpose of the project is to deliver a viable product that could be replicated
            for a reasonable price for both end-user and business alike. We believe the market to
            be on a precipice of further explosive growth, with the consumer market partially
            realised, but far from tapped by curent offerings.
            \subsubsection{Metrics}
                The metrics measured included will be: 
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Temperature
                    \item Humidity
                    \item Motion
                \end{itemize}
                We anticipate further development on the project to be viable post submission date,
                however realise the limitations of the current timeframe.
                \par
                Metrics measured would be viewable on a users dashboard, with data being able to be
                scoped to multiple filter requirements such as time, select edge cases or specific 
                locations.
                \\
                The end-goal being an ability for users to better determine inefficient or bad decisions
                they may make unwittingly in regards to home or business heating, coupled with the 
                impact of room utilisation.

    \section{Project Objectives}
        Within the timeframe still available to this project, we aim to develop and deploy a number of 
        IoT devices\cite{ESP8266} to a home enviroment or two and to track heat, humidity and motion of the
        dwelling to better understand the potential correlations of room use, heating and potential 
        inefficiencies created in areas such as 'High Traffic' spots (Loungerooms and Hallways)
        \\
        Optimally we ain to couple this with a mapping of the dwelling, allowing a more intuitive expression 
        of the data collected.
        \par
        We intend on using student subscriptions to leverage Azure for both website hosting and databasing 
        coupled with a small budget of roughly \$100-\$200 to purchase all required equipment which currently
        is expected to be:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item ESP8266 boards
            \item DHT11 Temperature and Humidity sensors\cite{DHT11}
            \item XC-4444 PIR Motion sensors\cite{XC-4444}
            \item Various required breadboards / generic electronics items
        \end{itemize}

        Overall goals of the project\\
        Remember Objectives must be SMART!\\
        Answers What, When, \& How Much
