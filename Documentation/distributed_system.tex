    \section{Project Scope Document}
        \subsection{Introduction}
        The basic concept of this project will be to create a distributed system in which small 
        devices are used to monitor, log and warn of select metrics from a multitude of 
        potential data points.
        \subsection{Target Audience}
        The proposed target audience for this project are a wide range of individuals whom may
        wish to monitor any of the proposed metrics from the wireless devices. The design
        of this system allows for highly customisable systems that would be easy to imlement and 
        preconfigured, with a view to write a management software that would allow end users to
        reconfigure the system as required at any point.
        \subsection{Metrics}
        Proposed metrics to be monitored include:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Temperature
            \item Pressure (atmospheric)
            \item Humidity
            \item Sound (Decibels)
            \item Sound (Ultrasonic or Subsonic levels)
            \item Wind Speed
            \item UV 
            \item Infared (Movement detection)
            \item Visible Light Levels
            \item Soil Moisture
            \item Acceleration
            \item Orientation/Tilt (x, y, z) of devices
            \item Rain Sensor
            \item Vibration
        \end{itemize}

        \pagebreak

        \subsection{Project Infastructure}
        Proposed hardware for the project would run on a mixture of ESP8266 or
        RaspberryPi like boards, made highly available of recent for reasonable prices.
        \\
        Back-end hardware is proposed as any system that can host a number of services related
        to the project. The most essential of these services would include the storage of logging
        achieved by a database. Given the nature of open-source databases we can confidently assume either
        cloud hosting or localised hosting of a system is a non-concern.

        \subsection{Project Services}
            \subsubsection{Database Service}
            The database service would be a simple API callable via a http post request, it would sit behind 
            and MVC style application, allowing us to setup unique routes to define request types, or it could
            be a post of some json data which would define the table to be inserted into.
            \\
            The later of these suggestions are less desirable as the devices could be reflashed to act 
            negatively against the service host which likely would be centralised and not self-hosted in the
            deployed product.

            \subsubsection{User Management Service}
            A user management serice would be required to ensure security of an individuals privacy.
            This, as above would be best preflashed and not apparent to the end-user, taking the form of
            some kind of expirable token.
            \\
            The service would require some kind of method to associate a user with devices at the point of sale
            or some kind of method akin to that implemented by the Particle board range \cite{Particle}
            which associates a serial or UUID/GUID code to identify the device in question.
            This would be pre-programmed at build time to be stored in the database so no management 
            other than the entry of such a UUID/GUID would be required by the end-user.

            \subsubsection{Logging Service}
            The logging service would need to act as middleware between the devices and the database and 
            potentially require some level of parsing of data and verification of data. Failing either of the
            parsing or authentication, the Logging service should push errors to the Error Management service.
            \\
            Without errors occuring, the logging service should pass data required to the database service which
            would perform required tasks to store such data.

            \subsubsection{Error Handling Service}
            The Error handling service would log errors from either data pushed by end devices or the websystem itself,
            the logs would include stack-trace material, cause for logging, associated user data and timestamps.
